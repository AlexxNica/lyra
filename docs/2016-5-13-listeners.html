            <div class="description"><p>This namespace defines all of the functions that are bound, directly or
indirectly, to the Redux store via the <code>store.subscribe</code> method. Because this
relationship can be tricky to test, given the global and changeable nature
of the store, this file deviates from the pattern established elsewhere in
the repostory and adopts a dependency-injection-based approach. The individual
functions that handle certain types of Store -&gt; Vega updates each take an
argument representing the relevant store state, and an argument representing
the Vega view (or the Lyra model itself): in this way their behavior can be
validated using mock objects without having to set up a global store in the
test environment.</p>
<p>As for the primary <code>syncStoreToVega</code> listener, it is created through a function
which takes in the store itself and all of the functions which it must orchestrate,
and returns the final listener method.</p></div>
