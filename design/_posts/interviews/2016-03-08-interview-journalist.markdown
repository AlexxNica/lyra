I interviewed a Data Vis engineer who works for a newspaper about the frustrations a non-technical journalist using a data vis tool would have.

One main concern is giving a tool to a journalist who does not have any statistical training.

### How to represent data
- can make nice graphs that don't have the right information
- What charts to use for different types of data
 - what to use if you are showing change over time
 - what to use if you are showing correlation etc
- Giving suggestions of charts:  barchart, bubble charts, treemaps, timelines

### Data
- aren't aware of what bad data is
 - that you can't have data that's full of null values and expect it to make anything
 - knowing when an outlier is a mistake vs a story they should look into
 - knowing what realistic scales are for their data
 - accounting for things like inflation or population before working with the data
- being able to understand the data they are looking at
 - what does each column header mean mean
 - where it came from and how it was collected

### High level information
Problems typically aren't things like "don't use this color for accessibility reasons"  they are more fundamental like "what question do you want to answer with this visualization?"
- making sure it conveys useful information
- making sure it is conveying the RIGHT information

Suggests having default/minimum settings for styles and advanced menus for customization.
