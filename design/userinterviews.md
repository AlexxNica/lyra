User interviews are a great way to develop empathy for your application's users and learn about their goals and frustrations.  They are also a good way to prevent your own biases about what a user wants from dictating your work.


When you interview a user or potential user, you want to find out as much as possible about them. What they do for a living, their daily routine, are they task oriented, are they frustrated, what things do they like to do on their spare time?


Asking these kinds of questions will give you a well rounded idea of who your user is and help you make decisions about what needs to go into your work and why it needs to be that way.
